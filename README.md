This repository provides Python examples for tasks air quality managers
identified as high need. The examples have been tested with Python (v3.9-v3.12)
and are applied to the CAMx (v7.3) tutorial dataset. Most of the exercises are
applicable to CMAQ and other models.

Objectives:

* Prepare modified emissions from existing model-ready files,
* Evaluate CAMx using surface monitors,
* Compare CAMx to satellite columns, and
* Compare CAMx results with and without emission modifications.
