Point Source Emission Examples
------------------------------

There are currently two point source examples:

* Make a single representative source file.
* Perturb a facilities based on latitude/longitude.

*Caveat*:
These point source examples can be adapted to do many things, but there are
limitations. For example, sometimes "point source emissions" are split between
the amount subject to plume rise and the rest may be merged with the gridded.
In that case, scaling the point source file is not equivalent to scaling a
facility.
