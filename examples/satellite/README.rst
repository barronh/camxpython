Satellite Comparison
--------------------

There are currently two satellite processing examples.

* OMI NO2 comparison without updating the model prior, and
* TropOMI NO2 comparison with an updated model prior.

Satellite NO2 use modeled NO2 (eg, GMI or TM5) to quantify the vertical
distribution of NO2, which allows for a quantitative translation from
measurements with differential vertical sensitivity to a best estimate
assuming equal sensitivity. Using your own model as the vertical
distribution ensures an apples to apples comparison.
